#Purpose:

I use Github with a team of developers to develop a large web application. Although Github is a wonderful tool, there are a few pain points I needed to fix myself.

This extension changes the color of the of notifications that I am participating in so I can quickly address issues relevant to me. 
We also use Github for code reviews. This extension allows users to hide files in pull requests. I find this helpful when pull requests are longer than a few files. 

#To Install:

[Install Github Workflow from the Chrome Web Store!](http://bit.ly/1MKUxmg)
