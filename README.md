#Purpose:

When I recieve notifications for issues in GitHub, I must mouse over the avatars in order to see who is assigned to the issue. This extension will change the color of the circle icon to the left of the notification from green to red in order to indicate that the user is associated with a particular issue. 

#To Install:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/djds23/github-notif-helper`
2. Fire up chrome and open the extensions tab, this should be in menu>tools>extensions
3. Check the Developer mode box at the top right of this tab
4. Drag and drop the directory containing the repo onto the extensions window

#TODO: 

* allow extension to work on more than just `github.com/notifications`
* allow one to make notes for themselves on notifications / issues
